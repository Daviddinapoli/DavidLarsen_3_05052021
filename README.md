Project 3 of the OpenClassroom Web Developer course - Ohmyfood!

The purpose of this project is to create a mobile website with animations for a new restaurant platform. The site lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive.

In this project it is recommended to start using Sass to learn how to simplify writing your CSS when on bigger projects.

Here below you can find the Mock-Up for the homepage and one restaurant menu as an example.

Edited parts:
Problem 1, in red, shows the hearts escaping the restaurant cards on the left. They should be contained within the card.

Problem 2, in blue, this space could be occupied several columns of restaurant cards or wider centered cards.
